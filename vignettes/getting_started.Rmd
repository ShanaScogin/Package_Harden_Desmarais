## Introduction
This vignette introduces you to the modeLLtest R package. The modeLLtest name points to the use of cross-validated log likelihood (CVLL) values as a way to compare the fit of different coefficients within a model. This can be compared across competing models to choose the model which will produce coefficient estimates closest to the true coefficient values. The tests include the cross-validated difference in means (CVDM) test, the cross-validated median fit (CVMF) test, and bias corrected Vuong tests. The CVMD and CVMF tests employ leave-one-out cross-validation, an out-of-sample method for computing model fit (Harden and Desmarais 2011; Desmarais and Harden 2012; Desmarais and Harden 2014). More on the bias corrected Vuong tests here (Harden and Desmarais 2013).

"A likelihood function can be used to compute the likelihood of having observed the
data on hand, given that the data were drawn from the model corresponding to that likelihood function and vector of parameters" (Appendix, Harden and Desmarais 2011)
