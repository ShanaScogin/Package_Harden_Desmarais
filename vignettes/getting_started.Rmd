## Introduction
This vignette introduces you to the modeLLtest R package. The modeLLtest name points to the use of cross-validated log likelihood (CVLL) values as a way to compare the fit of different coefficients within a model This can be compared across competing models to choose the model which will produce coefficient estimates closest to the true coefficient values. The tests include the cross-validated difference in means (CVDM) test, the cross-validated median fit (CVMF) test, and bias corrected Vuong tests. The CVMD and CVMF tests employ leave-one-out cross-validation, an out-of-sample method for computing model fit (Harden and Desmarais 2011; Desmarais and Harden 2012; Desmarais and Harden 2014). More on the bias corrected Vuong tests here (Harden and Desmarais 2013).
