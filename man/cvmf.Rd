\usage{
cvmf(formula, data, method = "efron", trunc = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object, with the response on the left of a ~
operator, and the terms on the right. The response must be a survival
object as returned by the Surv() function from the survival package.}

\item{data}{A data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by
as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model
or in the subset and the weights argument.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method for tie handling.
If there are no tied death times all the methods are equivalent.
Following the coxph() function in the survival package, the Efron
approximation is used as the default. The survival package justifies this
due to the Efron method being is more accurate when dealing with tied death
times, and is as efficient computationally than the common Breslow method.
The "exact partial likelihood" is equivalent to a 'conditional logistic model,
and is appropriate when the times are a small set of discrete values.
See documentation from survival package for more.}

\item{trunc}{Roughtly, quantile of the sample T_i exp(Î²'Z_i). It determines
the trimming level for the robust estimator. An argument in the coxr() function
in the coxrobust package.}

\item{ties}{An alternate name for for the \code{methods} argument}
}
\value{
An object computed by the cross-validated median fit test
(CVMF) to test between the PLM and IRR methods of estimating the Cox model.
}
\description{
Applies cross-validated log-likelihood to test between
partial likelihood maximization (PLM) and the iteratively reweighted
robust (IRR) method of estimation for a given application of the Cox model.
}
\details{
This function implements the cross-validated median fit (CVMF) test.
The function cvmf() tests between the partial
likelihood maximization (PLM) and the iteratively reweighted robust
(IRR) method of estimation for a given application of the Cox model.
The Cox model is a partial parametric model that does not make assumptions
about the baseline hazard. It can be estimated via PLM, the standard
estimator, or IRR, a robust estimator that identifies and downweights
outliers. The choice between the two methods involves a trade-off
between bias and efficiency. PLM is more efficient, but biased under
specification problems. IRR reduces bias, but results in high
variance due to the loss of efficiency. This function returns an
object to distinguish the prefered estimation.
