# modeLLtest
An R Package which implements model comparison tests using cross-validated log likelihood (CVLL) values. 

# Test Overviews
An R package which implements model comparison tests. The tests include the cross-validated difference in means (CVDM) test, the cross-validated median fit (CVMF) test, and bias corrected Vuong tests. The relevant papers including details can be found below:
