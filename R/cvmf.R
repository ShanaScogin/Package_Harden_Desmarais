#'This function implements the cross-validated median fit (CVMF) test.
#'The function cvmf() tests between the partial
#'likelihood maximization (PLM) and the iteratively reweighted robust
#'(IRR) method of estimation for a given application of the Cox model.
#'The Cox model is a partial parametric model that does not make assumptions
#'about the baseline hazard. It can be estimated via PLM, the standard
#'estimator, or IRR, a robust estimator that identifies and downweights
#'outliers. The choice between the two methods involves a trade-off
#'between bias and efficiency. PLM is more efficient, but biased under
#'specification problems. IRR reduces bias, but results in high
#'variance due to the loss of efficiency. This function returns an
#'object to distinguish the prefered estimation.

#'@title Cross-Validated Median Fit (CVMF) Test
#'@description Applies cross-validated log-likelihood to test between
#'partial likelihood maximization (PLM) and the iteratively reweighted
#'robust (IRR) method of estimation for a given application of the Cox model.
#'@param formula A formula object, with the response on the left of a ~
#'operator, and the terms on the right. The response must be a survival
#'object as returned by the Surv() function from the survival package.
#'@param data A data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by
#'as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model
#'or in the subset and the weights argument.
#'@param method A character string specifying the method for tie handling.
#'If there are no tied death times all the methods are equivalent.
#'Following the coxph() function in the survival package, the Efron
#'approximation is used as the default. The survival package justifies this
#'due to the Efron method being is more accurate when dealing with tied death
#'times, and is as efficient computationally than the common Breslow method.
#'The "exact partial likelihood" is equivalent to a 'conditional logistic model,
#'and is appropriate when the times are a small set of discrete values.
#'See documentation from survival package for more.
#'@param trunc A value that determines the trimming level for the robust
#'estimator. The default is 0.95. Roughtly, quantile of the sample T_i exp(Î²'Z_i).
#'It is an argument in the coxr() function in the coxrobust package.
#'@param na.action A missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame,
#'after any subset argument has been used.
#'@param f.weight
#'@param weight
#'@param init
#'@param control
#'@param singular.ok Logical value indicating how to handle collinearity in the
#'model matrix. If \code{TRUE}, the program will automatically skip over columns
#'of the X matrix that are linear combinations of earlier columns. In this case
#'the coefficients for such columns will be NA, and the variance matrix will contain
#'zeros. For ancillary calculations, such as the linear predictor, the missing
#'coefficients are treated as zeros.
#'@param model
#'@param subset Expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be
#'used in the fit. All observations are included by default.
#'@return An object computed by the cross-validated median fit test
#' (CVMF) to test between the PLM and IRR methods of estimating the Cox model.
